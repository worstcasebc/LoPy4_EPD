BAGHDAD ... Pressured by an expanding protest movement and a rising death toll, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said Friday that he would submit his resignation to Parliament, taking the country into greater uncertainty and possibly months of turmoil ahead.
Mr. Mahdis resignation would make him another prominent political casualty in a wave of recent antigovernment unrest that has swept the region.
Deep-seated anger over corruption and Irans influence in Iraqi politics are the major drivers of the protests across Iraq. In Lebanon, citizen rage over that countrys dysfunctional government pushed its prime minister to announce his resignation in October. And in Iran itself, the authorities scrambled to crush protests and riots in 100 cities set off a few weeks ago by an abrupt increase in fuel prices ... the deadliest unrest to hit Iran in years.
The prime ministers announcement was a particularly bitter blow for Iran, which had handpicked Mr. Mahdi and on Wednesday suffered an attack on its consulate in the southern city of Najaf. The building was severely damaged by firebombs thrown by protesters.
Iran has repeatedly sought to prop up Mr. Mahdi since he became prime minister in 2018, according to leaked Iranian intelligence reports obtained by The Intercept and shared with The New York Times. Mr. Mahdi worked closely with Iran while Saddam Hussein was in power, and for years he served as a member of a large Shiite party tied to Iran. He became an independent in 2017, but the leaked cables suggest he kept close ties to Iran in recent years.
Mr. Mahdis announcement on Friday initially prompted jubilant celebrations at the main protest site, Tahrir Square in Baghdad, but the happiness faded quickly, tempered by mourning for people killed in the protests and an acknowledgment there will be little immediate change.
“This is the first step,” said Hiatt Mehdi, 60, a widow with seven children, including a son who has been demonstrating for the last 35 days without coming home. She had come to Tahrir Square to congratulate her son that his efforts seemed to have been rewarded by Mr. Mahdi’s announcement.
“But it’s really not enough.” she said.
Mr. Mahdis decision was announced a day after at least 40 protesters were killed in a violent crackdown following the attack on the Iranian Consulate that fanned demonstrations across Iraqs Shiite south.
